# Benefits and Challenges of Using Third Party APIs with NestJS

## API

An API is a connection or a middleman between computers or computer programs. It defines a set of rules about how the computers or computer programs should interact with each other. 

## Third Party APIs

These are APIs provided by a third party such as Facebook , Google e.t.c. which allow you to access their functionality. Popular third party APIs include:

**Google Maps API**:  Allows you to provide location data such as maps in your application.

**Facebook Graph API**:  Allows you to access facebook data such as user profiles.

**OpenWeatherMap API**:- Allows you to access weather data.





## Benefits

### Efficiency

Using third-party APIs, you can quickly implement functionality that otherwise would have taken crucial time and effort to build. This helps to speed up the development of your application.


### Maintenance

The members of your team don't have to maintain third party services. It is up to the company which provides the service to maintain it. This allows a team to use their resources elsewhere.

### Cost Reduction

Implementing some features in-house can prove costly. Using third party APIs saves your company a lot of money.

### Scalability

Third party APIs can handle large amount of data. This makes them a great option for an application which might scale.

## Challenges

### Security

For Third Party APIs, your data is used by the company which maintains the API. If that company does not follow the best practices of security, your data may get compromised.

### Flexiblility

Third Party APIs are not very customizable. If you are using a third party API, your application is bound to that API. If you want to extend or modify the functionality of the API, it can prove very difficult.

### Changes

As time passes, the endpoints of the third party API may change with updates. In this case, your application will have to be modified so that it can work with the changes made. 

### Performance

Depending on how responsive the servers of the company which maintains the APIs are, a performance bottleneck may be caused. As a result, the speed, performance and responsiveness of your application may be reduced.
