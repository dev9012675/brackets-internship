## Week 6:Day 2

For this day's task, I created an AuthorSchema.I have created a one to many relationship between Authors and Books by using **ref** in both their respective schemas. I have created book and author services to manage create , read and update operations and have also created book and author controllers to handle GET, PUT and
POST requests for books and authors. For the GET request endpoints, I am using populate to fetch related data.
