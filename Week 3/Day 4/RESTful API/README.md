# Services and Dependency Injection

For this task, I have created a service using the @Injectable Decorator named StudentsService and injected it into StudentsController using Dependency Injection by injecting it into the StudentsController constructor . The
endpoints I implemented in the previous lesson can now be used to get and store data temporarily because I am
storing the POST request data into an array.The data vanishes as soon as program execution is stopped.
