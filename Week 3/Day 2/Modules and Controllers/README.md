# Modules and Controllers

For this task, I have created a controller using the @Controller Decorator named StudentsController and a module StudentsModule in the src/students directory . In StudentsController, I have implemented GET /students , POST /students and GET /students/:id endpoints using the @Get and @Post Decorators.
